# TERRA PROTECT
 

Terra Protect is a vision-based sand depletion monitoring system that leverages LoRaWAN technology, the Wio Terminal, a lithium battery, a solar panel, and TP4056 to track sand depletion in construction sites, beaches, and other areas where sand is a valuable resource. In India, sand depletion is a significant issue, with an estimated 10 billion tons of sand extracted annually, leading to environmental degradation and erosion.
The system utilizes computer vision algorithms and a camera to capture and analyze images, estimating the amount of sand present in a given area. The data is transmitted to a LoRaWAN gateway, which sends it to a cloud-based platform for storage and analysis.
With its user-friendly Wio Terminal interface, Terra Protect provides real-time data and allows remote system configuration. The lithium battery and solar panel ensure uninterrupted operation, even in remote areas with no access to mains electricity, while the TP4056 optimizes battery charging for extended system life.
Terra Protect has significant potential to improve sand resource management in construction sites and other locations in India. Real-time data on sand depletion can aid decision-making processes and lead to more efficient use of sand resources. Furthermore, the system can also be applied to environmental monitoring, providing critical data on erosion and other natural processes.
In conclusion, Terra Protect is a cost-effective and innovative solution that can have a positive impact on sand resource management and environmental monitoring in India, where the issue of sand depletion and erosion is particularly pressing.
